| CVE-2016-3087 | Apache Struts 2.3.20.x before 2.3.20.3, 2.3.24.x before 2.3.24.3, and 2.3.28.x before 2.3.28.1, when Dynamic Method Invocation is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to an ! (exclamation mark) operator to the REST Plugin. |
| CVE-2016-4338 | The mysql user parameter configuration script (userparameter_mysql.conf) in the agent in Zabbix before 2.0.18, 2.2.x before 2.2.13, and 3.0.x before 3.0.3, when used with a shell other than bash, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or SQL commands via the mysql.size parameter. |
| CVE-2016-5195 | Race condition in mm/gup.c in the Linux kernel 2.x through 4.x before 4.8.3 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging incorrect handling of a copy-on-write (COW) feature to write to a read-only memory mapping, as exploited in the wild in October 2016, aka "Dirty COW." |

| CVE-2016-6415 | The server IKEv1 implementation in Cisco IOS 12.2 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.6, IOS XE through 3.18S, IOS XR 4.3.x and 5.0.x through 5.2.x, and PIX before 7.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from device memory via a Security Association (SA) negotiation request, aka Bug IDs CSCvb29204 and CSCvb36055 or BENIGNCERTAIN. |
| CVE-2016-7124 | ext/standard/var_unserializer.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 mishandles certain invalid objects, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data that leads to a (1) __destruct call or (2) magic method call. |
| CVE-2017-0199 | Microsoft Office 2007 SP3, Microsoft Office 2010 SP2, Microsoft Office 2013 SP1, Microsoft Office 2016, Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted document, aka "Microsoft Office/WordPad Remote Code Execution Vulnerability w/Windows API." |
| CVE-2017-1000353 | Jenkins versions 2.56 and earlier as well as 2.46.1 LTS and earlier are vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution. An unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability allowed attackers to transfer a serialized Java `SignedObject` object to the Jenkins CLI, that would be deserialized using a new `ObjectInputStream`, bypassing the existing blacklist-based protection mechanism. We're fixing this issue by adding `SignedObject` to the blacklist. We're also backporting the new HTTP CLI protocol from Jenkins 2.54 to LTS 2.46.2, and deprecating the remoting-based (i.e. Java serialization) CLI protocol, disabling it by default. |
| CVE-2017-12615 | When running Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 to 7.0.79 on Windows with HTTP PUTs enabled (e.g. via setting the readonly initialisation parameter of the Default to false) it was possible to upload a JSP file to the server via a specially crafted request. This JSP could then be requested and any code it contained would be executed by the server. |
| CVE-2017-17411 | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on vulnerable installations of Linksys WVBR0 WVBR0. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the web management portal. The issue lies in the lack of proper validation of user data before executing a system call. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code with root privileges. Was ZDI-CAN-4892. |
| CVE-2017-5135 | Certain Technicolor devices have an SNMP access-control bypass, possibly involving an ISP customization in some cases. The Technicolor (formerly Cisco) DPC3928SL with firmware D3928SL-P15-13-A386-c3420r55105-160127a could be reached by any SNMP community string from the Internet; also, you can write in the MIB because it provides write properties, aka Stringbleed. NOTE: the string-bleed/StringBleed-CVE-2017-5135 GitHub repository is not a valid reference as of 2017-04-27; it contains Trojan horse code purported to exploit this vulnerability. |
| CVE-2017-5638 | The Jakarta Multipart parser in Apache Struts 2 2.3.x before 2.3.32 and 2.5.x before 2.5.10.1 has incorrect exception handling and error-message generation during file-upload attempts, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted Content-Type, Content-Disposition, or Content-Length HTTP header, as exploited in the wild in March 2017 with a Content-Type header containing a #cmd= string. |
| CVE-2017-5689 | An unprivileged network attacker could gain system privileges to provisioned Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT) and Intel Standard Manageability (ISM). An unprivileged local attacker could provision manageability features gaining unprivileged network or local system privileges on Intel manageability SKUs: Intel Active Management Technology (AMT), Intel Standard Manageability (ISM), and Intel Small Business Technology (SBT). |
| CVE-2017-7494 | Samba since version 3.5.0 and before 4.6.4, 4.5.10 and 4.4.14 is vulnerable to remote code execution vulnerability, allowing a malicious client to upload a shared library to a writable share, and then cause the server to load and execute it. |
| CVE-2017-8464 | Windows Shell in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10 Gold, 1511, 1607, 1703, and Windows Server 2016 allows local users or remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .LNK file, which is not properly handled during icon display in Windows Explorer or any other application that parses the icon of the shortcut. aka "LNK Remote Code Execution Vulnerability." |
| CVE-2017-9791 | The Struts 1 plugin in Apache Struts 2.3.x might allow remote code execution via a malicious field value passed in a raw message to the ActionMessage. |
| CVE-2018-4407 | Apple iOS 11 and earlier, Apple macOS High Sierra, up to and including 10.13.6, Apple macOS Sierra, up to and including 10.12.6, Apple OS X El Capitan and earlier. A heap buffer overflow is allowed in Apple's XNU operating system kernel. |
| CVE-2018-7600 | Drupal before 7.58, 8.x before 8.3.9, 8.4.x before 8.4.6, and 8.5.x before 8.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an issue affecting multiple subsystems with default or common module configurations. |
| CVE-2018-10562 | An issue was discovered on Dasan GPON home routers. Command Injection can occur via the dest_host parameter in a diag_action=ping request to a GponForm/diag_Form URI. Because the router saves ping results in /tmp and transmits them to the user when the user revisits /diag.html, it's quite simple to execute commands and retrieve their output. |
